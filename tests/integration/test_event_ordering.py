    # values into the greenlet while it context switches to give other
    # greenlets a chance to run.

    # First we setup a fake connection. It mimics a connection that does
    # not have data waiting in the buffer, and has to wait for the system
    # to call it back when data is ready on the socket. The delay argument
    # specifies how long the test should wait before simulating that data
    # is ready.

    # Next we setup a Queue instance and prime it with a value, so it will
    # be ready early and return an EarlyValue.

        #    callback to be triggered when data is ready (which our
        #    FakeConnection will simulate).
        # 2) Fetches from the 'q' which will result in an EarlyValue.

        # What must happen is that the callback registered to handle data
        # from the FakeConnection when it arrives MUST BE CANCELED/DISCARDED/
        # FORGOTTEN/NEVER CALLED. If it gets called, it will muck with
        # internal state, and possibly switch back into the running greenlet
        # with an unexpected value, which will throw off the ordering of
        # internal state and basically break everything.
